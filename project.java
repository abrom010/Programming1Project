6 - Write a program that simulates a statistics tool, by letting the user determine the minimum, the
maximum, the range (maximum – minimum), the mode (value that is repeated more often), the mean
(average), and the standard deviation of a set of numbers. These numbers, that will be stored in an
array, represent salaries in the $30K – $60K range and are to be generated randomly.
